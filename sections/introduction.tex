Sampling from a given distribution is a fundamental problem arising naturally in many fields 
such as bandit theory, machine learning, Bayesian statistics, etc. Among these problems, sampling from the class of 
distributions known as the log-concave distributions are of particular interest.
These distributions characterizes the uniform distributions on convex bodies and is related to the volumes
of said bodies. Beyond this, sampling from the log-concave measures is useful for optimization, e.g. 
minimizing convex functions. 

Sampling from these distributions has been studied for a long time and there are many algorithms 
devised to do so.
