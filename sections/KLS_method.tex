\subsection{Reduction of KLS to thin-shell}\label{sec:KLS_to_TS}

We will now present a proof of theorem~\ref{thm:KLS_to_TS}.
As a high level overview, recall that the linear-tilt localization of a given measure is a measure-valued martingale
for which the original measure is recovered in the limit. Then, as the concentration of the measure 
relates to the covariance of said measure, we will stop the martingale before the covariance grows too large. 
This allows us to analyze the martingale in a more tractable manner. However, as the the sequence is 
a martingale, some properties are invariant in time and hence allowing us to conclude that these properties 
also hold for the original measure.

We recall the goal of theorem~\ref{thm:KLS_to_TS} is to control \(\text{Var}_\mu[\phi]\) by 
a logarithmic factor of \(\text{Var}_\mu[\|\cdot\|]\). We will assume \(\mu\) is supported on 
\(B_n(0) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) with 
\(B_n(0)\) the ball at the origin of radius \(n\). The reason for this is due to a concentration 
bound for log-concave measures where one may show most of their densities lie within a compact support.
As a result, the region outside said compact set only contributes a bounded amount (in fact, it decreases 
in \(n\)) to the variance, and does not affect our computation (c.f. \cite{Klartag_2006}). 
Thus, we also have 
\[\text{supp}\ \mu_t = \text{supp}\ F_t\mu \subseteq \text{supp}\ \mu \subseteq B_n(0)\] 
for all \(t > 0\).
 
Let us fix \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) some 1-Lipschitz function and let \((M_t)\) be the 
martingale as described in corollary~\ref{cor:lim_mart}, we have \(\text{Var}_\mu[\phi] = \text{Var}[\phi(a_\infty)]\) 
where \(a_\infty \sim \mu\).
Then, for all \(t > 0\), by the law of total variance and the martingale property we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:variance}
  \begin{split}
    \text{Var}_\mu[\phi] = \text{Var}[M_\infty] & = \text{Var}[\mathbb{E}[M_\infty \mid \mu_t]] + \mathbb{E}[\text{Var}[M_\infty \mid \mu_t]]\\
    & = \text{Var}[M_t] + \mathbb{E}[\text{Var}[M_\infty \mid \mu_t]]
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where we introduce the notation \(\text{Var}[X \mid \mathcal{G}] := \mathbb{E}[(X - \mathbb{E}[X \mid \mathcal{G}])^2 \mid \mathcal{G}]\)
for some random variable \(X\) and sub-\(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{G}\). Furthermore, by replacing 
\(\phi\) in corollary~\ref{cor:lim_mart} with \(\phi^2\) and denoting the resulting martingale 
\(N_t := \int \phi^2 \dd \mu_t\), we obtain \(N_t \to \phi(a_\infty)^2\) and hence,
\begin{align*}
  \text{Var}[M_\infty \mid \mu_t] & = \mathbb{E}[\phi(a_\infty)^2 \mid \mu_t] - M_t^2 = N_t - M_t^2\\ 
    & = \int \phi^2 \dd \mu_t - \left(\int \phi \dd \mu_t\right)^2 = \text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi]
\end{align*}
Combining this with equation~\eqref{eq:variance}, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bound}
  \text{Var}_\mu[\phi] = \text{Var}[M_t] + \mathbb{E}[\text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi]].
\end{equation}
for any \(t \ge 0\). Furthermore, by applying the optional stopping theorem, the same equality holds 
when we take \(t\) to be a stopping time. 

At this point, by recalling proposition~\ref{prop:linear-tilt_ACV}, we recognize that the first term 
\(\text{Var}[M_t] = \mathbb{E}[M]_t\) is controlled by the operator norm of \(A_t\) with \(A_t\) being the covariance matrix of \(\mu_t\).
Thus, to bound the first term, the idea is to choose an appropriate stopping time \(\tau\) to 
stop the process before \(\|A_t\|_\text{op}\) grows too large. On the other hand, for the given \(\tau\), by plugging in 
equation~\eqref{eq:stoch_loc_alt} into lemma~\ref{lem:brascamp-lieb},
the second term \(\text{Var}_{\mu_\tau}[\phi]\) is then bounded by \(\tau^{-1}\) for which the
expectation can be bounded explicitly.

We dedicate the remainder of this section to describe said procedure in detail.

% by recalling proposition~\ref{prop:linear-tilt_ACV} and lemma~\ref{lem:brascamp-lieb}, 
% we may recognize that the first term \(\text{Var}[M_t]\) is controlled by the operator norm of \(A_t\) (the covariance 
% matrix of \(\mu_t\)) while the second term \(\text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi]\) is bounded by \(t^{-1}\). 
% Thus, with this in mind, the idea now is to choose such an appropriate random time \(\tau\) to stop the process such that 
% \(\mathbb{E}[M]_\tau\) is nicely bounded. Then, the result follow by bounding \(\mathbb{E}[\tau^{-1}]\). 

% At this point, by recalling by lemma~\ref{lem:brascamp-lieb}, we see that the second term can be bounded 
% by \(\mathbb{E}[\text{Var}_{\mu_\tau}[\phi]] \le \mathbb{E}[\tau^{-1}]\) for any stopping time \(\tau\)
% as \(\phi\) is 1-Lipschitz implies \(\|\nabla \phi\|^2 \le 1\).
% % (in fact \(\text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi] \le t^{-1} \wedge n^2\) as we have assumed \(\text{supp}\ \mu_t \subseteq B_n(0)\)).

% \subsubsection{Differential of the quadratic variation}

% To bound the term \(\mathbb{E}[M]_\tau\) we will compute its differential and bound it 
% sufficiently such that we reobtain a bound for \([M]_\tau\) after integration. 
% We will show \(\dd[] [M]_t\) is bounded by a quantity concerning \(A_t\). This should not be at all 
% surprising as both \(\dd[] [M]_t\) and \(A_t\) describes the variation of \(M_t\) in a infinitesimal time 
% neighborhood of \(t\).

% We compute
% \begin{align*}
%   \dd M_t & = d \int \phi(x) F_t(x) \mu(\dd x) = \int \phi(x) \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t \rangle \mu_t(\dd x)\\
%   & = \left\langle \int \phi(x)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x), \dd W_t\right\rangle
% \end{align*}
% and so, by considering the component-wise quadratic variation, we have
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:diff_qvar}
%   \dd[] [M]_t = \left\| \int \phi(x)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x) \right\|^2 \dd t.
% \end{equation}
% Then, denoting \(\theta\) the vector \(\int \phi(x)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x)\) normalized to have norm 1, so 
% \[\left\langle \theta, \int \phi(x)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x)\right\rangle = \left\|\int \phi(x)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x)\right\|\]
% we observe,
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:red_a}
%   \begin{split}
%     \dd[] [M]_t & = \left\langle \theta, \int \phi(x)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x)\right\rangle^2 \dd t
%       = \left\langle \theta, \int \left(\phi(x) - \int \phi \dd \mu_t\right)(x - a_t)\mu_t(\dd x)\right\rangle^2 \dd t\\
%     & = \left(\int \left(\phi(x) - \int \phi \dd \mu_t\right) \langle \theta, x - a_t\rangle \mu_t(\dd x)\right)^2 \dd t\\
%     & \le \left(\int \left(\phi(x) - \int \phi \dd \mu_t\right)^2 \mu_t(\dd x)\right) \left(\int \langle \theta, x - a_t\rangle^2 \mu_t(\dd x)\right) \dd t\\
%     & = \text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi] \left(\int \theta^T (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \theta \mu_t(\dd x)\right) \dd t
%       = \text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi] (\theta^T A_t \theta)\dd t\\ 
%     & \le \text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi] \|A_t\|_{\text{op}} \dd t.
%   \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% where the inequality follows by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and \(\|\cdot\|_{\text{op}}\) denotes the operator norm. 
% Thus, as we know \(\text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi] \le t^{-1}\), the problem is now reduced to that of
% bounding \(\|A_t\|_{\text{op}}\).

\subsubsection{Analysis of the covariance matrix}

As demonstrated in section~\ref{sec:construct}, we know the limiting behavior of the covariance matrices, namely 
\(A_t \to 0\) point-wise as \(t \to \infty\). This was important for us to establish the existence of the limit 
of \((a_t)\) and \((M_t)\). However, as shown above, we now require some quantitative bounds for the operator 
norm of \(A_t\). For this purpose, we first compute some useful properties of \(A_t\).

Observing 
\[\int \dd F_t(x) \mu(\dd x) = \int \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t\rangle \mu_t(\dd x) = 
  \left\langle\int x \mu_t(\dd x) - a_t, \dd W_t\right\rangle = 0,\]
we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff_center}
  \begin{split}
    \dd a_t & = \dd \int x F_t(x) \mu(\dd x) = \int x \dd F_t(x) \mu(\dd x) 
        = \int (x - a_t) \dd F_t(x) \mu(\dd x)\\
      & = \int (x - a_t) \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t \rangle F_t(x) \mu(\dd x) 
        = \int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \dd W_t \mu_t(\dd x) = A_t \dd W_t
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the second to last equality used the fact that \(v \langle v, w \rangle = v^{\otimes 2} w\) for 
any appropriate \(v, w\).

Similarly, computing using Itô's formula, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff_cov_aux}
  \begin{split}
    \dd A_t & = \dd \int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} F_t(x) \mu(\dd x)\\
      & = \int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \dd F_t(x) + F_t(x) \dd (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2}\\
      & \hspace{1cm} - 2 (x - a_t) \otimes \dd[][a_t, F_t(x)]_t +F_t(x)\dd[][a_t]_t\mu(\dd x).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
The second term vanishes as 
\[\int F_t(x) \dd (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \mu(\dd x) = -2 \dd a_t \otimes 
  \overbrace{\int (x - a_t) \mu_t(\dd x)}^{= 0} = 0.\]
Also, by equation~\eqref{eq:diff_center}, \(\dd a_t = A_t \dd W_t\) implying \(\dd[][a_t]_t = A_t^2 \dd t\).
Finally, as both \((a_t)\) and \((F_t(x))\) are martingales, \(\dd[] [a_t, F_t(x)]_t = F_t(x) A_t x \dd t\) 
and the third term becomes
\begin{align*}
  -2 \int (x - a_t) \otimes \dd[] [a_t, F_t(x)] \mu_t(\dd x) 
  & = - 2A_t \left(\int (x - a_t) \otimes x \mu_t(\dd x)\right) \dd t \\
  & = -2 A_t \left(\overbrace{\int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \mu_t(\dd x)}^{A_t} + 
    \overbrace{\int (x - a_t) \mu_t(\dd x)}^{= 0} \otimes a_t \right) \dd t\\ 
  & = -2 A_t^2 \dd t.
\end{align*}
Hence, combining these and equation~\eqref{eq:stoch_loc} together in \eqref{eq:diff_cov_aux}, we have
\[\dd A_t = \int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t \rangle \mu_t(\dd x) - A_t^2 \dd t\]
However, since we wish to bound \(A_t\) from above, as the drift term \(- A_t^2 \dd t\) only contributes 
negatively, an upper bound for the process of the form 
\(\int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t \rangle \mu_t(\dd x)\) is also sufficient for \(A_t\).
Hence, we proceed by ignoring the drift term and redefine the process \(A_t\) such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diff_cov}
  \dd A_t = \int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t \rangle \mu_t(\dd x).
\end{equation}
With this justification, we now proceed to bound the operator norm of this new \(A_t\). In particular, 
as \(A_t\) is symmetric, we recall that \(\|A_t\|_{\text{op}} = \max_{i= 1, \cdots, n} \lambda_i(t) = \|(\lambda_i(t))_{i = 1}^n\|_\infty\) 
where \(\lambda_i(t)\) denotes the distinct eigenvalues of \(A_t\). Hence, it suffices to find a bound for the potential 
\begin{equation}
  \Phi^{\alpha}(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^n |\lambda_i(t)|^{\alpha} = \|(\lambda_i(t))_{i = 1}^n\|_\alpha^\alpha
\end{equation} 
for some \(\alpha > 0\). Furthermore, as \(A_t\) is positive 
semi-definite, \(\lambda_i(t) \ge 0\) for all \(i = 1, \cdots, n\) and thus we have
\(\Phi^\alpha(t) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^{\alpha}\). Again, to proceed, we will attempt to compute 
\(\dd \Phi^\alpha(t)\) at some \(t = t_0 > 0\) utilizing the following simple lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:diff_eig}
  If \(A = [a_{ij}]\) is a diagonal matrix with distinct eigenvalues \(\lambda_i, \cdots, \lambda_n\), then 
  for all \(i, j, k, l, m \in {1, \cdots n}\), we have
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\pdv{\lambda_i}{a_{jk}} = \delta_{ij} \delta_{ik}\);
    \item whenever \(i \neq j\), \(\pdv[2]{\lambda_i}{a_{ij}} = 2(\lambda_i - \lambda_j)^{-1}\);
    \item and for \(j \neq l, k \neq m\) or \(i \neq j\) and \(i \neq k\),
      \(\pdv[2]{\lambda_i}{a_{jk}}{a_{lm}} = 0\),
  \end{itemize}
  where \(\delta_{ij}\) denotes the Kronecker delta function.
\end{lemma}

As this lemma requires the matrix to be diagonal, denoting \(e_1, \cdots, e_n\) as the normalized 
eigenbasis of \(A_{t_0}\) (they are in fact orthonormal as \(A_{t_0}\) is positive semi-definite), 
we will consider \(A_t\) with respect to this basis by considering the entries 
\[a_{ij}(t) := \langle e_i, A_t e_j\rangle.\]
Using equation~\eqref{eq:diff_cov}, we compute 
\begin{align*}
  \dd a_{ij}(t) & = \left\langle e_i, \left(\int (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} 
    \langle x - a_t, \dd W_t \rangle \mu_t(\dd x)\right) e_j \right\rangle\\
    & = \left\langle\int \langle e_i, (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} e_j\rangle
      (x - a_t) \mu_t(\dd x), \dd W_t\right\rangle
      = \langle \xi_{ij}, \dd W_t\rangle
\end{align*}
where we introduce the notation \(\xi_{ij} = \int \langle e_i, (x - a_t)^{\otimes 2} e_j\rangle (x - a_t) \mu_t(\dd x).\)
Thus, combining this with lemma~\ref{lem:diff_eig}, 
denoting \(\lambda_i = \lambda_i(t_0)\), we have by Itô's formula
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \dd \lambda_i(t) 
    & = \sum_{j, k = 1}^n \pdv{\lambda_i}{a_{jk}} \dd a_{jk}(t) 
      + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j, k = 1}^n \sum_{l, m = 1}^n \pdv[2]{\lambda_i}{a_{jk}}{a_{lm}} \dd[] [a_{jk}, a_{lm}]_t\\
    & = \langle \xi_{ii}, \dd W_t\rangle + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\dd[][a_{ij}]_t}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}
      = \langle \xi_{ii}, \dd W_t\rangle + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\|\xi_{ij}\|^2}{\lambda_i - \lambda_{j}} \dd t.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
at \(t = t_0\). As a result, it is also clear that \(\dd[][\lambda_i(t)]_{t_0} = \|\xi_{ii}\|^2 \dd t\). 

Again applying Itô's formula, we may finally compute
\begin{align*}
  \dd \Phi^\alpha(t) & = \sum_{i = 1}^n \pdv{\Phi^\alpha}{\lambda_i}\Big\vert_{t = t_0} \dd \lambda_i(t)
    + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i, j = 1}^n \pdv[2]{\Phi^\alpha}{\lambda_i}{\lambda_j}\Big\vert_{t = t_0} \dd[][\lambda_i, \lambda_j]_{t}\\
  & = \alpha \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 1} \dd \lambda_i(t)
    + \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 2} \dd[][\lambda_i(t)]_{t}\\
  & = \alpha \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 1} \left(\langle \xi_{ii}, \dd W_t\rangle 
    + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{\|\xi_{ij}\|^2}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j} \dd t\right) 
    + \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 2} \dd[][\lambda_i(t)]_{t}\\
  & = \alpha \sum_{i \neq j}\lambda_i^{\alpha - 1} \frac{\|\xi_{ij}\|^2}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j} \dd t 
    + \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 2} \|\xi_{ii}\|^2 \dd t
    + \left\langle\underbrace{\alpha \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 1} \xi_{ii}}_{=: v_t}, \dd W_t\right\rangle\\
  & = \frac{1}{2}\alpha \sum_{i \neq j}\|\xi_{ij}\|^2\frac{\lambda_i^{\alpha - 1} - \lambda_j^{\alpha -1}}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}\dd t
    + \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^{\alpha - 2} \|\xi_{ii}\|^2 \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle\\
  & \le \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1) \sum_{i \neq j}\|\xi_{ij}\|^2 (\lambda_i \vee \lambda_j)^{\alpha - 2} \dd t
    + \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1)\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^{\alpha - 2} \|\xi_{ii}\|^2 \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle\\
  & = \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - 1) \sum_{i, j = 1}^n\|\xi_{ij}\|^2 (\lambda_i \vee \lambda_j)^{\alpha - 2} \dd t
    + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle
    \le \alpha^2 \sum_{i, j = 1}^n\|\xi_{ij}\|^2 \lambda_i^{\alpha - 2} \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle,
\end{align*}
where the first inequality holds as 
\[\frac{\lambda_i^{\alpha - 1} - \lambda_j^{\alpha -1}}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}
  = \lambda_i^{\alpha - 2} + \lambda_i^{\alpha - 3}\lambda_j + \cdots + \lambda_i^{\alpha - 2} 
  \le (\alpha - 1)(\lambda_i \vee \lambda_j)^{\alpha - 2}.\]
Thus, we have shown 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential_bound}
  \dd \Phi^\alpha(t) \le \alpha^2 \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^{\alpha - 2} \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\xi_{ij}\|^2 \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle
\end{equation}
where \(v_t := \alpha \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i^{\alpha - 1}\xi_{ii}\).

By recalling that our goal is to bound \(\|A_t\|_{\text{op}}\) from above (c.f. equation~\eqref{eq:bound} and \eqref{eq:red_a}), 
we may assume without loss of generality that \(\|A_t\|_{\text{op}} \ge 1\). Thus, applying the reverse Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to 
equation~\eqref{eq:potential_bound}, we have
\begin{align*}
  \dd \Phi^\alpha(t) & \le 2\alpha^2 \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^{\alpha - 2} \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\xi_{ij}\|^2 \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle\\
    & \le 2\alpha^2 \|A_t\|_{\text{op}}^2 \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^{\alpha - 2} \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\xi_{ij}\|^2 \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle\\
    & \lesssim 2\alpha^2\sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_i(t)^\alpha \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\xi_{ij}\|^2 \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle.
\end{align*} 
Thus, defining \(K_t := \sup_i \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\xi_{ij}\|^2\), we have the asymptotic bound 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential_bound_2}
  \dd \Phi^\alpha(t) \lesssim 2\alpha^2 K_t \Phi^\alpha(t) \dd t + \langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Stopping the process early}

As outlined in the beginning of this section, we will stop the process early in order to provide a 
bound for the right hand side of equation~\eqref{eq:bound}. By observing equation~\eqref{eq:red_a}, we hypothesize that
we should stop the process once \(\|A_t\|_{\text{op}}\) grows too large. As a result we define the stopping time 
\[\tau := \inf\{t > 0 \mid \|A_t\|_{\text{op}} > 2\} \wedge 1.\]
By the optional stopping theorem, proposition~\ref{prop:linear-tilt_ACV} and the fact that we had assumed 
\(\mu\) is supported in a ball of radius \(n\), we have
\begin{align*}
  [M]_\tau & = \int_0^\tau \dd[] [M]_t 
      \le \int_0^\tau \overbrace{\text{Var}_{\mu_t}[\phi]}^{\le t^{-1} \wedge n^2} \overbrace{\|A_t\|_{\text{op}}}^{\le 2} \dd t\\
    & \le 2 \int_0^\tau t^{-1} \wedge n^2 \dd t \le 2 \int_0^1 t^{-1} \wedge n^2 \dd t = 2 + 4 \log n.
\end{align*}
Combining this with equation~\eqref{eq:bound} (where we recall that \(\text{Var}[M_t] = \mathbb{E}[M]_t\)),  we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_bd}
  \text{Var}_\mu[\phi] \le 2 + 4 \log n + \mathbb{E}[\tau^{-1}],
\end{equation}
and it remains to find an upper bound for \(\mathbb{E}[\tau^{-1}]\). Observing that \(t < \tau\) whenever 
\(\Phi^\alpha(t) < 2^\alpha\), we define \(\sigma\) the first time for which the potential \(\Phi^\alpha(t)\) reaches \(2^\alpha\),
namely
\[\sigma := \inf \{t > 0 \mid \Phi^\alpha(t) = 2^\alpha\},\] 
we have \(\sigma^{-1} \ge \tau^{-1}\) and so it suffices to bound \(\sigma\) from below. 

For simplicity, we will ignore the martingale term in equation~\eqref{eq:potential_bound_2} and regard it as an ODE. 
Then, by Gronwall's inequality, if we can 
find some constant \(K\) such that \(K_t \le K\) for all \(t \le \tau\), we have the bound
\[S_t \le n e^{2\alpha^2 K t}.\]
Thus, substituting \(\sigma\) into the above, we have 
\[2^\alpha = S_\sigma \le ne^{2\alpha^2 K\sigma}\]
implying 
\[\frac{\alpha \log 2 - \log n}{2\alpha^2 K} \le \sigma \le \tau.\]
Then, taking \(\alpha = 10K\log n\), it is easy to check that 
\[\frac{1}{10K \log n} \le \frac{\alpha \log 2 - \log n}{2\alpha^2 K}\]
implying \(\mathbb{E}[\tau^{-1}] \le 10K \log n\). Of course, this deduction only holds while ignoring the stochastic term 
\(\langle v_t, \dd W_t\rangle\). Nonetheless, this can be justified as one can show that \(\|v_t\|_2\) is bounded 
\(\alpha \Phi^\alpha(t)\) and so the same analysis holds by applying the stochastic Gronwall's inequality
(c.f. second part of lemma 34 in \cite{Lee_2018}).

Finally, to find a bound for \((K_t)\), we employ the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}[Lemma 1.6 in \cite{Eldan_2013}]\label{lem:final_bd}
  Denoting \(C_{\text{TS}}^n\) as in theorem~\ref{thm:KLS_to_TS}, there exists a constant \(C\) such that 
  for any log-concave, isotropic probability measure \(\mu\), we have
  \[\sup_{\theta \in S^{n - 1}}\sum_{i, j = 1}^n 
    \mathbb{E}_{X \sim \mu}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle \langle X, \theta\rangle]^2 \le 
    C \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k(C_{\text{TS}}^n)^2},\]
  where \(\{e_1, \cdots, e_n\}\) is any orthonormal basis on \(\mathbb{R}^n\).
\end{lemma}

Recalling that
\[\xi_{ij} = \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu_t}[\langle e_i, X^{\otimes 2} e_j\rangle X] = 
  \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu_t}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle X],\]
we have by Parseval's identity 
\begin{align*}
  K_t & = \sup_i \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\xi_{ij}\|^2 
    = \sup_i \sum_{j = 1}^n \|\mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu_t}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle X]\|^2\\
  & = \sup_i \sum_{j = 1}^n \sum_{k = 1}^n 
    \left\langle \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu_t}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle X], e_k\right\rangle^2\\
  & = \sup_i \sum_{j, k = 1}^n \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu_t}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle \langle X, e_k\rangle]^2\\
  & \le \sup_{\theta \in S^{n - 1}}\sum_{i, j = 1}^n 
    \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle \langle X, \theta\rangle]^2.
\end{align*}
We note that we cannot direct apply lemma~\ref{lem:final_bd} at this point since the measure \(\mu_t\) 
might not be isotropic. Hence, to be able to use the lemma, we need to normalize the covariance of \(\mu_t\). 
Namely, taking \(X + a_t \sim \mu_t\), we define \(Y = A^{-1/2} X\) which by construction is isotropic. 
Thus, by observing that 
\[\mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle \langle X, \theta\rangle]^2 
  \le \|A_t\|_{\text{op}}^3 \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu}[\langle Y, e_i\rangle \langle Y, e_j\rangle \langle Y, \theta\rangle]^2,\]
we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:K_bd}
  \begin{split}
    K_t & \le \sup_{\theta \in S^{n - 1}}\sum_{i, j = 1}^n 
        \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu}[\langle X, e_i\rangle \langle X, e_j\rangle \langle X, \theta\rangle]^2\\
      & \le \|A_t\|_{\text{op}}^3 \sup_{\theta \in S^{n - 1}}\sum_{i, j = 1}^n 
        \mathbb{E}_{X + a_t \sim \mu}[\langle Y, e_i\rangle \langle Y, e_j\rangle \langle Y, \theta\rangle]^2
        \le 8 C \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k(C_{\text{TS}}^n)^2}
      \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the last inequality follows as \(\|A_t\|_{\text{op}} \le 2\) for all \(t < \tau\). 
    
At last, combining equation~\eqref{eq:tau_bd} and~\eqref{eq:K_bd}, we have
\[\text{Var}_\mu[\phi] \le 2 + \log n\left(4 + \overbrace{80 C \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{1}{k}}^{\Theta(\log n)}(C_{\text{TS}}^n)^{-2}\right)
   = \Theta_n(((C_{\text{TS}}^n)^{-1} \log n)^2)\]
implying there exists a constant \(R > 0\) such that for all 1-Lipschitz \(\phi\), 
\(\sqrt{\text{Var}_\mu[\phi]} \le R (C_{\text{TS}}^n)^{-1} \log n\), i.e. \(\mu\) is 
\((R\log n)^{-1} C_{\text{TS}}^n\)-concentrated and so, \(C_{\text{TS}}^n \lesssim C_{\text{con}}^n \log n\)
as required.
