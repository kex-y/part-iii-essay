Our proof of the Prékopa-Leindler theorem is simpler than the original one. We sharpen the inequality that the marginal of a log concave function is log concave, and we prove various moment inequalities for such functions. Finally, we use these results to derive inequalities for the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation with a convex potential.}

	abstract = {The class of logconcave functions in ℝn is a common generalization of Gaussians and of indicator functions of convex sets. Motivated by the problem of sampling from logconcave density functions, we study their geometry and introduce a technique for “smoothing” them out. These results are applied to analyze two efficient algorithms for sampling from a logconcave distribution in n dimensions, with no assumptions on the local smoothness of the density function. Both algorithms, the ball walk and the hit-and-run walk, use a random walk (Markov chain) to generate a random point. After appropriate preprocessing, they produce a point from approximately the right distribution in time O*(n4) and in amortized time O*(n3) if n or more sample points are needed (where the asterisk indicates that dependence on the error parameter and factors of log n are not shown). These bounds match previous bounds for the special case of sampling from the uniform distribution over a convex body.© 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
