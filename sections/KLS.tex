While the KLS conjecture is often phrased as a isoperimetric problem, we will mainly consider the 
conjecture here as a problem regarding measures while providing some discussions regarding its 
equivalent formulations. \todo{Mention we only work with Borel measures}

\subsection{Concentration}

\begin{definition}[Concentration, \cite{Eldan_notes}]
  Let \(\mu\) be a measure on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), then \(\mu\) is said to be \(C\)-(inversely)-concentrated if
  for all \(1\)-Lipschitz function \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\), 
  \begin{equation}
    \text{Var}_\mu[\phi] = \text{Var}_{X \sim \mu}[\phi(X)] \le C^2.
  \end{equation}
  We denote the least possible such \(C\) by \(C^\mu_{\text{con}}\).
\end{definition}

Heuristically, the concentration measures the relation between \(\mu\) and the Euclidean metric by 
providing a numerical control for the variance of its norm. This is perhaps best illustrated by the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(X\) be a \(\mathbb{R}^n\)-valued random variable. Then for all \(K\)-Lipschitz function 
  \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\),
  \[\text{Var}[\phi(X)] \le K^2 \text{Var}[\|X\|^2].\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  WLOG. by subtracting its expectation from \(X\), we may assume \(\mathbb{E}[X] = 0\).
  Let \(X'\) be a i.i.d. copy of \(X\) on the same probability space. Then for all \(K\)-Lipschitz 
  function \(\phi\), we have 
  \begin{align*}
    2 \text{Var}[\phi(X)] & = \text{Var}[\phi(X) - \phi(X')] & (\text{i.i.d.})\\
      & = \mathbb{E}[(\phi(X) - \phi(X'))^2] - \mathbb{E}[\phi(X) - \phi(X')]^2 & \\
      & = \mathbb{E}[(\phi(X) - \phi(X'))^2] & (\text{identically distributed}) \\
      & \le K^2 \mathbb{E}[\|X - X'\|^2] & (\text{as \(\phi\) is \(K\)-Lipschitz}) \\
      & = K^2 \mathbb{E}[X^T X + X'^T X' - X^T X' - X'^T X] & \\
      & = 2K^2 \text{Var}[\|X\|^2] - 2K^2 \text{Cov}(X, X') = 2K^2 \text{Var}[\|X\|^2]. & (\text{independence})
  \end{align*}
  implying \(\text{Var}[\phi(X)] \le K^2 \text{Var}[\|X\|^2]\) as claimed.
\end{proof}

With this proposition in mind, it is clear that for \(\mathbb{R}\)-valued random variables \(X\), 
its law \(\mu\) has concentration \(C^\mu_{\text{con}} = \text{Var}[X]\). Furthermore, by 
considering the projection maps, it follows that the standard Gaussian measure on \(\mathbb{R}^n\) 
is 1-concentrated.

We note that the definition we are presenting here is slightly non-standard. However, utilising a 
remarkable result due to Milman, we show that this definition is equivalent to the following 
definitions in a specific sense.

\begin{definition}[Exponential concentration, \cite{Milman_2018}]
  Given a measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), we say \(\mu\) has exponential concentration if 
  there exists some \(c, D > 0\) such that for all 1-Lipschitz function 
  \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}, t > 0\), we have
  \begin{equation}
    \mu(|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]| \ge t) \le c e^{-Dt}.
  \end{equation}
  Fixing \(c = 1\), we denote the largest possible \(D\) as \(D^\mu_{\text{exp}}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[First-moment concentration, \cite{Milman_2018}]
  Again, given \(\mu\) a measure on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), we say \(\mu\) has first-moment concentration 
  if there exists some \(D > 0\) such that for all 1-Lipschitz function 
  \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\), we have
  \begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}_\mu[|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]|] \le \frac{1}{D}.
  \end{equation}
  We denote the largest possible \(D\) by \(D^\mu_{\text{FM}}\).
\end{definition}

It is clear that exponential concentration implies first-moment concentration. Indeed, if \(\mu\) 
has exponential concentration with constant \(D\) (taking \(c = 1\)), then by the tail probability formula,
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}_\mu[|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]|] 
  & = \int_0^\infty \mu(|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]| \ge t) \dd t \le \int_0^\infty e^{-Dt} \dd t 
   = \frac{1}{D}.
\end{align*}

On the other hand, Milman showed that for log-concave measures (namely, measures of the form 
\(\dd \mu = \exp(-H)\dd\text{Leb}^n\) for some convex function 
\(H : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}\)) on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), exponential concentration 
and first-moment concentration are equivalent in the following sense. 

\begin{theorem}[Milman, \cite{Milman_2008}]\label{thm:milman}
  For all log-concave measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), \(\mu\) has exponential concentration 
  if and only if \(\mu\) has first-moment concentration. Furthermore, 
  \(D^\mu_{\text{exp}} \simeq D^\mu_{\text{FM}}\) where we write \(A \simeq B\) if there exists 
  universal constants \(C_1, C_2 > 0\) such that \(C_1 A \le B \le C_2 A\).
\end{theorem}

With this theorem in mind, we establish the following correspondence.

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:equiv}
  For all measures \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), we have 
  \[\text{Exponentially concentrated \(\implies\) Concentrated \(\implies\) First-moment concentrated}\]
  and \(D^\mu_{\text{exp}} \le \sqrt{2} (C^\mu_{\text{con}})^{-1}\) and 
  \((2C^\mu_{\text{con}})^{-1} \le D^\mu_{\text{FM}}\).
  Hence, if \(\mu\) is log-concave, 
  \(D^\mu_{\text{exp}} \simeq D^\mu_{\text{FM}} \simeq (C^\mu_{\text{con}})^{-1}\).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Assume first that \(\mu\) is \(C\)-concentrated. Then by the Chebyshev inequality, we have 
  \[\mu(|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]| \ge t) 
      \le \frac{1}{t^2}\text{Var}_\mu[\phi] 
      \le \frac{C^2}{t^2},\]
  for all 1-Lipschitz \(\phi\). 
  Thus, by tail probability,
  \begin{align*}\mathbb{E}_\mu[|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]|] 
    & = \int_0^\infty \mu(|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]| \ge t) \dd t\\ 
    & \le \inf_{a > 0} \left\{\int_0^a \mu(|\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi]| \ge t) \dd t + C^2 \int_a^\infty \frac{1}{t^2} \dd t\right\}\\ 
    & \le \inf_{a > 0} \left\{a + \frac{C^2}{a}\right\} = 2C,
  \end{align*}
  implying \(\mu\) is first-moment concentrated with respect to the constant \((2C)^{-1}\).

  On the other hand, if \(\mu\) is exponential concentration with some constant \(D\), then 
  again by the tail probability, 
  \[\text{Var}_\mu[\phi] = \int_0^\infty \mu((\phi - \mathbb{E}_\mu[\phi])^2 \ge t) \dd t
      \le \int_0^\infty e^{-D \sqrt{t}} \dd t = \frac{2}{D^2}\]
  implying \(\mu\) is \(\sqrt{2} D^{-1}\)-concentrated.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The KLS and thin-shell conjecture}

Informally, the KLS conjecture suggests that any log-concave measure on \(\mathbb{R}^n\) admits 
the same concentration as that of the Gaussian measure. However, unlike the Gaussian, as the 
concentration of measures is not invariant under linear transformations, it is clear that the KLS 
conjecture would not hold without a suitable normalization. This leads us to the following formulation 
of the KLS conjecture.

\begin{conjecture}[Kannan-Lovász-Simonovitz, \cite{Eldan_notes}]
  Denoting \(\mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}}\) the set of all log-concave probability measures \(\mu\) on 
  \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying \(\text{Var}_\mu[T] \le 1\) for all 1-Lipschitz linear maps 
  \(T : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\), there exists a \textit{universal} constant \(C\) such that for all 
  \(\mu \in \mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}}\), \(\mu\) is \(C\)-concentrated.
\end{conjecture}

We remark that \(C\) is universal in the sense that it does not depend on any parameter and in 
particular is independent of the dimension \(n\).

\begin{conjecture}[Thin-shell, \cite{Eldan_2013}]
  Taking \(\mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}}\) as above, there exists a universal constant \(C\) such that 
  for all \(\mu \in \mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}}\), we have
  \[\sqrt{\text{Var}_\mu[\|\cdot\|]} \le C.\]
\end{conjecture}

As the norm function is 1-Lipschitz, it is \textit{a priori} that the thin-shell conjecture is 
weaker than that of the KLS conjecture. On the other hand, as we shall describe in the next section, 
as a consequence of the stochastic localisation scheme, Eldan \cite{Eldan_2013} provides a reduction 
of the KLS conjecture to the thin-shell conjecture up to logarithmic factors. 

\begin{theorem}[Eldan, \cite{Eldan_2013}]\label{thm:KLS_to_TS}
  Denoting \(\mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}}\) as above, we define 
  \[C^n_{\text{con}} := \inf \left\{C \mid \text{\(\forall \mu \in \mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}},\) 
    \(\mu\) is \(C\)-concentrated}\right\},\]
  and 
  \[C^n_{\text{TS}} := \inf \left\{C \mid \text{\(\forall \mu \in \mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}},\) 
      \(\sqrt{\text{Var}_\mu[\|\cdot\|]} \le C\)}\right\}
      = \sup_{\mu \in \mathscr{M}^n_{\text{con}}} \sqrt{\text{Var}_\mu[\|\cdot\|]},\]
  we have,
  \[C^n_{\text{TS}} \le C^n_{\text{con}} \le C^n_{\text{TS}} \log n.\]
\end{theorem}

We remark that while the constants in theorem~\ref{thm:KLS_to_TS} depends on the dimension \(n\), if 
\(\sup_n C^n_{\text{TS}} \log n < \infty\), we can obtain the universal bound for the KLS conjecture 
by taking the constant \(C = \sup_n C^n_{\text{con}} \le \sup_n C^n_{\text{TS}} \log n < \infty\).

\subsubsection{Equivalent formulation of the KLS conjecture}

While the formulation of the KLS conjecture above is very useful, as mentioned previously, the KLS 
conjecture has several equivalent formulations; we will quickly present them here. However, before 
stating these formulations, let us quickly complete theorem \ref{thm:milman} with two 
additional equivalences.

\begin{definition}[Cheeger's inequality, \cite{Milman_2008}]
  Given a measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), we recall the Minkowski's boundary measure 
  defined by 
  \[\mu^+(A) := \liminf_{\epsilon \downarrow 0} \frac{\mu(A_\epsilon) - \mu(A)}{\epsilon}\]
  where \(A_\epsilon := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \text{dist}(x, A) \le \epsilon\}\) is the 
  \(\epsilon\)-thickening of some Borel set \(A\). Then, we say \(\mu\) satisfy Cheeger's inequality 
  if there exists some \(D\) such that for all \(A\) satisfying \(\mu(A) \le \frac{1}{2}\),
  \todo{This definition is from Eldan not Milman, can we show equivalence?}
  \[\mu(A) \le D\mu^+(A).\]
  We denote the largest such \(D\) by \(D^\mu_{\text{C}}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Milman, \cite{Milman_2008}]\label{thm:milman2}
  For all log-concave measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(\mu\) has exponential concentration with constant \(D^\mu_\text{exp}\).
    \item \(\mu\) has first-moment concentration with constant \(D^\mu_\text{FM}\).
    \item \(\mu\) satisfy the Cheeger's inequality with constant \(D^\mu_\text{C}\).
    \item \(\mu\) satisfy the Poincaré inequality: there exists some \(D > 0\) such that for all 
      differentiable \(\phi : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying \(\int \phi \dd\mu = 0\), we have
      \[D \cdot \text{Var}_\mu[\phi] \le \int \|\nabla \phi\|^2 \dd\mu.\]
      We denote the largest such \(D\) by \(D^\mu_{\text{P}}\).
  \end{itemize}
  Furthermore, \(D^\mu_{\text{exp}} \simeq D^\mu_{\text{FM}} \simeq D^\mu_{\text{P}} \simeq D^\mu_{\text{C}}\).
\end{theorem}

With this theorem and proposition \ref{thm:equiv} in mind, it is clear that the KLS conjecture can be 
instead formulated with any of these inequalities instead. 

\begin{conjecture}[KLS, \cite{Eldan_2013}]
  Denoting \(\mathscr{M}_{\text{iso}}\) the set of all log-concave probability measures \(\mu\) on 
  \(\mathbb{R}^n\) satisfying \(\int x \mu(\dd x) = 0\) (namely \(\mu\) is isotropic), there exists
  a \textit{universal} constant \(D\) such that for all \(\mu \in \mathscr{M}_{\text{iso}}\), 
  \(\mu\) satisfy the Cheeger's inequality with constant \(D\).\todo{Why are the normalisations equivalent?}
\end{conjecture}

Similarly, we may also reformulate the KLS conjecture using the constant provided by the Poincaré inequality. 

\begin{conjecture}[KLS, \cite{Eldan_2013}]
    Denoting \(\mathscr{M}_{\text{iso}}\) as above, there exist a \textit{universal} constant \(D\) 
    such that for all \(\mu \in \mathscr{M}_{\text{iso}}\), \(\mu\) satisfy the Poincaré inequality 
    with constant \(D\).
  \end{conjecture}
  
  By observing that \(\text{Var}_\mu[\phi] = \int \phi^2 \dd \mu\) for all differentiable \(\phi\) 
  satisfying \(\int \phi \dd \mu = 0\), we remark that the Poincaré inequality can be alternatively 
  written as 
  \[\frac{\int \phi^2 \dd \mu}{\int \|\nabla \phi\|^2 \dd \mu} \le D^{-1}.\]
